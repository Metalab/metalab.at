                <div class="text">
                    <p> Metalab is a space where you can pursue your curiosity, realize unique ideas or meet and
                        exchange with others. As Vienna's oldest and largest hackerspace, Metalab offers an atmosphere
                        where people of all skill levels interested in art, technology, society, and sciences come
                        together to share knowledge and work on personal and collaborative projects. </p>

                <h3>What is a Hackspace?</h3>
                <div class="text">
                    <p> As an activity, hacking is not just restricted to breaking into computer systems. Before
                        Hollywood hijacked the term for underwhelming action movies, hacking meant using knowledge and
                        curiosity to overcome technical and creative challenges. Many things, be it software systems,
                        clothing, hardware, or even your body, can and should be hacked. </p>
                    <p> A hackspace is a community-operated workspace where hackers with common interests can meet,
                        exchange knowledge and work on projects with their peers. </p>

                <h3>Creativity and Knowledge</h3>
                <div class="text">
                    <p> Metalab lives and thrives off its members and community, allowing for horizontal knowledge
                        transfer. You can find groups interested in programming, network technology, ham radio,
                        electronics, robotics, art, activism, and inclusivity. </p>
                    <p> Interest groups meet for regular meetups and workshops, offering talks and hands-on experience.
                        These events are usually open to the public and free of charge. </p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p> Members and guests often host events, lectures, workshops, and meetups, most of which can be
                        visited without registering. Here is a calendar of the upcoming public events at Metalab. Feel
                        free to check them out and see if something piques your interest. </p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p> We consider ourselves an inclusive community where everyone is welcome regardless of age,
                        ethnicity, gender, sexuality, income, or religion. We aim to provide an environment of mutual
                        respect, tolerance, and encouragement. </p>
                    <p> Metalab collaborates with <a href="https://defineblind.at">Define</a> and <a
                           href="https://machs-auf.at">MACH'S AUF!</a> to make the space more inclusive towards Deaf,
                        blind, and visually impaired people. </p>
                    <p> Unfortunately, the space is not fully wheelchair accessible because there is a small staircase
                        at the entrance and in front of the restroom. </p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p> We have many tools and machines, including a laser cutter, 3D printers, a CNC mill, a lathe,
                        sewing machines, a vinyl plotter, and a well-stocked electronics laboratory. All of our tools
                        can be used by guests but may require supervision. If you want to use tools like the 3D printer,
                        CNC, or laser cutter, don’t hesitate to contact <a
                           href='mailto:core@metalab.at'>core@metalab.at</a> to find a date when someone can
                        supervise/help you. </p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p> Our space is mainly financed through memberships. You are not required to be a member to use the
                        space and host events, but it is encouraged if you visit regularly. The standard rate for
                        memberships is €30, reduced membership fees are available for students and people in financially
                        precarious situations. </p>
                    <p> Many tools and machines are free to use, though we are always happy about donations for
                        materials and maintenance. The main exception is our laser cutter, billed at €1.50/min of
                        cutting time. </p>

                    <p> Metalab is generally open every day after 6pm and often earlier if at least one member is in the

                    <p> For your first visit, we recommend coming during one of our regular open days (held on the
                        second Thursday and fourth Friday of each month). During the open day, people will always be
                        happy to provide a tour of the space and help you use our machines. Alternatively, you can also
                        visit during <a href='https://metalab.at/wiki/MetaInvasion_Day'>MetaInvasion day</a>, when the
                        space is exclusively open to women, agender, inter, non-binary, and trans people, as well as
                        people who are still questioning their gender. </p>
